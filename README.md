# Univ Stuff

This repository is where I document my journey as a Software Engineering student. Instead of mixing everything into messy semester folders, I divided this project into two main parts: university deliverables (assignments/tasks/projects) and personal notes.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Language Disclaimer**
> The content in this repository is a mix of Indonesian and English. I write in whatever language helps me process the concepts best at that moment. Expect code comments, notes, and logs to switch between the two freely.

## Digital Garden

Most of this repository is built around the idea of a digital garden. A blog usually shows highly polished posts ordered by publication date. A digital garden is different. It functions more like a public notebook.

Notes here are not strictly chronological. They are grouped by topics and how one concept links to another. Just like a real garden, some ideas are just seeds or rough drafts. Other notes are fully matured and constantly refined. The goal isn't to be perfect before publishing. The goal is to learn and connect information over time. I keep these notes here so my understanding of a subject doesn't vanish after final exams.

## Folder Structure

- **00_Meta** This holds configurations, templates for lab reports, and temporary scratchpads.
- **01_Notes** This is my actual digital garden. It contains concept notes, summaries, and personal reflections that link together.
- **02_Deliverables** This area is strictly for university logistics. It holds source code and assignments created to meet specific academic deadlines.
- **03_Sources** This folder is ignored by Git and stays on my local machine. It holds raw materials given by lecturers like PDF slides and syllabi.
